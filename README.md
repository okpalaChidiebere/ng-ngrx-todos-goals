# NgNgrxTodosGoals

This project is about learning how to use basic Redux in Angular applications. With the help of [Ngrx](https://ngrx.io/docs) we are able to integrate this very easily into Angular. I know all about Redux in React applications i just wanted to know how to apply thesame concepts in Angular ;)

## This I learned

- **Actions:** Learn about creating store actions in Angular. Learn how to create actions [here](https://ngrx.io/guide/store/actions). You can also group actions as well [see](https://ngrx.io/guide/store/action-groups)
- **Async Actions:** Async actions are handlers that could handle long running task that will eventually be updating your app store like database calls. I angular you make then using [here](https://ngrx.io/guide/effects/operators). I did not explore the Effects [lifecycle](https://ngrx.io/guide/effects/lifecycle) for this app.
- **Reducers:** Learn about creating store actions in Angular [here](https://ngrx.io/guide/store/reducers). I did not explore [ngrx Entity](https://ngrx.io/guide/entity) which i thinks makes your life easier as well as it creates all the reducers method for a state automatically
- **Initializing the store:** Learn about creating store actions in Angular [here](https://ngrx.io/guide/store/feature-creators)
- **MiddleWares:** Middleware are used to intercept actions before they are dispatched. Learn how to [here](https://ngrx.io/guide/store/metareducers)
- When it comes to using the Store state within a Component, you want to explore [selectors](https://ngrx.io/guide/store/selectors) and [component-store](https://ngrx.io/guide/component-store/initialization)
